## Maup
MAUP. is a web application for multi-channel synced visualizations of audio data.

## Motivation
I wanted to use Ableton's Connect kit but didn't feel like shelling out money for Max. This was the 2nd best option I could think of
to accompany visuals for the various tracks in a set. The benefit of course is that now users who don't use Live can take advantage of this tool.

## How to use

- [ ] Support for MIDI files, including envelopes
